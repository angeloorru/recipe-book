# Recipe app
## Introduction
Feel free to [use this repository as a template](../../generate) (Please don't fork!) or start from scractch.

The requirement is to build and end to end application consisting of a Typescript, React webapp, a Typescript API and a data store of your choice.
The spec below defines 3 user stories all with acceptance criteria. Do your best to interpret them and implement them. If you feel you're missing context, drop an email to tech-test@sero.life.

Could you provide a GitHub repository link with your work when you feel you've completed the task to tech-test@sero.life?

## End point implemented
`GET /recipes`: Lists all recipes
`POST /recipe`: Allow to search by name or ingredient
`POST /recipes`: Allow to add a new recipe
`DELETE /recipe/:id`: Allow to delete a recipe

## How to run the app

Open a terminal and run the following command to spin up the API and React UI

```
make install docker
```

_Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the UI_

## How to run the tests

Run the following command in a separate terminal (You must have your UI and API running)

```
make test
```

** Before running e2e tests, ensure that all three containers are running (`make install docker`)

## Local dev api build tool
Webpack has been implemented for local development.
To run it, navigate to the `api` folder and once there, type: 
```
npm run webpack
```

## Run unit tests locally
### API
From a terminal window, `cd` to the `api` folder and run the following command:
```
npm run test
```
To generate test coverage, run the following command:
```
test:coverage
```
### Front end
From a terminal window, `cd` to the `ui` folder and run the following command:
```
npm run test
```

### Run whole app stack locally (no docker)
- Set `PG_HOST` from env file to `127.0.0.1`
- `cd api`
- `npm run dev`

In a new terminal window:
- `cd ui`
- `npm start`

Finally, you can run only your postgres container using docker:
- `docker compose up -d recipe-book-postgres`

## Build an app for a chef to store their favorite recipes.
Ideal tech stack:
- Typescript
- React
- Cypress
- Docker

## Non-functional requirements
- Run the whole stack with `make install docker`
- Data is persisted when database is stopped and started
- End to end tests demonstrate acceptance criteria has been implemented
